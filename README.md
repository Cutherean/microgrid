# microgrid (wip readme)
This repository contains the code for our senior design project. The focus of this project is a "feasibility study of microgrids for load interfaces".
The project runs off two ESP32's. One of the ESP32's host the server runs Micropython using MicroWebSrv2 for its backend framework.

# file description
- python scripts
  - `boot.py` : default file the ESP32 looks for on startup
  - `AP.py` : creates access point for the server
  - `website.py` : MicroWebSrv2 instance for web routing
- misc. files
  - `csv.py` : creates and manages datapoints while the server is active
  - `RS232.py` : sends data to the ESP32 from the solar charge controller
  - `linear_actuator.py` : send commands to the Arduino to move the linear actuator vertically for the solar panel
  - `time_elapsed.py` : starts a timer for the session for data logging purposes

# usage
1. Flash the firmware onto the device
2. Flash `boot.py` and `sdcard.py` to the board using [ampy](https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-load-files-and-run-code/install-ampy)
3. Turn on any hardware needed
4. Open the ESP32 to your terminal/command line/whatever
5. Click the reset button on the board
6. Go to the IP address shown
