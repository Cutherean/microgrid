# microgrid (wip readme)
This repository contains the code for my senior design project. The focus of this project is a "feasibility study of a microgrid for load interfaces". 

It runs off two ESP32's. One of the ESP32's host the server runs Micropython using MicroWebSrv2 for its backend. 

# usage
